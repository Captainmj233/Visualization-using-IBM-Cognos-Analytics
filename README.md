In this project, I used IBM's Cognitive to develop a comprehensive Sales and Service dashboard, integrating various KPI metrics to facilitate data-driven insights. On the Sales dashboard, I visualized Profit in millions of US dollars, Quantity Sold, and Average Quantity Sold, while also creating bar charts for Quantity Sold by Model and a column chart for Profit by Dealer ID. For the Service dashboard, I captured the number of recalls per model using a column chart, customer sentiment through a treemap, and compared monthly car sales with profit using a combined line and column chart. Additionally, I used a heat map to analyze recalls by model and affected system, identifying potential outliers. This project effectively provided actionable insights into both sales performance and service metrics.
